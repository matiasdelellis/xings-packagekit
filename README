xings-packagekit
PackageKit clients for GTK desktops.

The xings-packagekit project is a set of clients for PackageKit, designed to
integrate with GTK desktops. Of course, in terms of design and integration, we
mean that we use this toolkit, hoping that it works on any desktop beyond Xfce
or Mate.

This is a fork of gnome-packagekit version 3.14.3 that we consider is the last
one with proper integration with other desktops.

Many thanks to Richard Hughes and all subsequent maintainers of the entire
PackageKit ecocystem.
